## Version Control

### Git Tools
Git is the backbone of modern version control systems. Install these tools to enhance your Git workflow:

- **Git**: Core version control system.
  ```bash
  pkg install git         # Install Git
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```

- **Git LFS**: Manage large files in Git repositories.
  ```bash
  pkg install git-lfs     # Install Git Large File Storage
  ```
  Initialize Git LFS:
  ```bash
  git lfs install
  ```

- **Tig**: A text-based interface for Git.
  ```bash
  pkg install tig         # Install Tig
  ```
  Launch Tig in a repository:
  ```bash
  tig
  ```

### Code Review
Enhance your code review process with better diff tools:

- **Diff-so-fancy**: Improve the readability of Git diffs.
  ```bash
  pkg install diff-so-fancy # Install Diff-so-fancy
  ```
  Configure Git to use it:
  ```bash
  git config --global pager.diff "diff-so-fancy | less --tabs=4 -RFX"
  ```

- **Delta**: Syntax highlighting for Git diffs.
  ```bash
  pkg install delta       # Install Delta
  ```
  Configure Git to use Delta:
  ```bash
  git config --global core.pager "delta"
  ```

## Debug Tools

### Debugging
Debugging tools help identify and resolve issues in your code:

- **GDB**: GNU Debugger for analyzing programs.
  ```bash
  pkg install gdb         # Install GDB
  ```
  Debug a program:
  ```bash
  gdb ./program
  ```

- **Strace**: Trace system calls made by a program.
  ```bash
  pkg install strace      # Install Strace
  ```
  Trace a program's system calls:
  ```bash
  strace ./program
  ```

- **Ltrace**: Trace library calls made by a program.
  ```bash
  pkg install ltrace      # Install Ltrace
  ```
  Trace a program's library calls:
  ```bash
  ltrace ./program
  ```

## Code Quality

### Analysis Tools
Ensure your code is clean, efficient, and free of bugs:

- **ShellCheck**: Analyze shell scripts for errors and improvements.
  ```bash
  pkg install shellcheck  # Install ShellCheck
  ```
  Analyze a shell script:
  ```bash
  shellcheck script.sh
  ```

- **Clang Tools**: Static analysis for C/C++ code.
  ```bash
  pkg install clang-tools # Install Clang Tools
  ```
  Run static analysis:
  ```bash
  clang-tidy file.cpp
  ```

- **Valgrind**: Detect memory leaks and performance issues.
  ```bash
  pkg install valgrind    # Install Valgrind
  ```
  Run Valgrind on a program:
  ```bash
  valgrind ./program
  ```

## Additional Notes

### Updating Tools
Keep your tools up to date to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Troubleshooting
If a tool fails to install or run:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Check for compatibility issues with your device architecture.
3. Reinstall the tool:
   ```bash
   pkg reinstall <tool-name>
   ```
