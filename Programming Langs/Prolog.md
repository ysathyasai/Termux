# Prolog Programming in Termux

## Overview
Prolog is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It is particularly well-suited for tasks that involve pattern matching, tree-based data structures, and automatic backtracking. In Termux, you can use SWI-Prolog, a comprehensive and powerful Prolog environment.

- **Language**: Prolog
- **Implementation**: SWI-Prolog
- **File Extensions**: `.pl`, `.pro`
- **Package Name**: `swi-prolog`

## Step 1: Installing SWI-Prolog

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install SWI-Prolog
To install SWI-Prolog, run the following command:
```sh
pkg install swi-prolog
```

### Verify Installation
To verify that SWI-Prolog has been installed correctly, you can check the version:
```sh
swipl --version
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Development Tools

### Install Build Tools
To compile and build Prolog projects, you may need additional build tools:
```sh
pkg install build-essential
```

## Step 3: Writing and Running Prolog Programs

### Example Program
Create a simple family relationships program in Prolog.

1. Open Termux and create a new file named `family.pl` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
    ```sh
    nano family.pl
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```prolog
    % Simple family relationships
    parent(john, mary).
    parent(john, tom).
    parent(mary, ann).

    ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
    ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y).
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X` in nano, `:wq` in vi).

### Running the Prolog Program
To run the Prolog program, use the `swipl` command:
```sh
swipl -s family.pl
```

Once in the SWI-Prolog interactive shell, you can query the program:
```prolog
?- ancestor(john, ann).
```

Output:
```
true.
```

## Step 4: Advanced Topics

### Using Prolog Modules
Prolog supports modular programming. You can create and use modules to organize your code.

#### Example Module (`math_utils.pl`)
1. Create a new file named `math_utils.pl`:
    ```sh
    nano math_utils.pl
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```prolog
    :- module(math_utils, [add/3, subtract/3]).

    add(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X + Y.
    subtract(X, Y, Z) :- Z is X - Y.
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

#### Using the Module in Your Program
1. Create a new file named `main.pl`:
    ```sh
    nano main.pl
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```prolog
    :- use_module(math_utils).

    main :-
        add(5, 3, Sum),
        subtract(5, 3, Difference),
        format('5 + 3 = ~w~n', [Sum]),
        format('5 - 3 = ~w~n', [Difference]).
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Run the program:
    ```sh
    swipl -s main.pl -g main -t halt
    ```

Output:
```
5 + 3 = 8
5 - 3 = 2
```

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Memory Limits
- **Cause**: Default memory limit is too low for large programs.
- **Solution**:
  Increase the memory limit:
  ```sh
  swipl --stack-limit=2G
  ```

### Issue 2: Missing Libraries or Modules
- **Cause**: Missing libraries or modules for specific functionality.
- **Solution**:
  Install the required libraries or modules:
  ```sh
  pkg install swi-prolog-lib
  ```

### Issue 3: Slow Performance
- **Cause**: High resource usage during execution.
- **Solution**:
  Close unnecessary apps to free up memory.
  Use lightweight scripts for testing.
