# Jupyter Notebook Programming in Termux

## Overview
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is widely used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, and machine learning.

- **Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook
- **File Extension**: `.ipynb`
- **Package Name**: `jupyter`

## Step 1: Installing Jupyter Notebook

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install Python
To install Python, run the following command:
```sh
pkg install python
```

### Install Pip
Pip is the package manager for Python. Install it by running:
```sh
pkg install python-pip
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook
To install Jupyter Notebook, use pip:
```sh
pip install jupyter
```

### Verify Installation
To verify that Jupyter Notebook has been installed correctly, you can run a simple command:
```sh
jupyter --version
```

## Step 2: Starting Jupyter Notebook

### Running Jupyter Notebook
To start Jupyter Notebook, use the following command:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

By default, Jupyter Notebook will start a local server and open your default web browser. If you are using Termux on a mobile device, you may need to specify the IP address and port to make it accessible from a browser on your device:

```sh
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser
```

You can then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to access Jupyter Notebook.

## Step 3: Writing and Running Jupyter Notebooks

### Creating a New Notebook
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`.
2. Click on "New" and select "Python 3" to create a new notebook.

### Example Notebook
Create a simple Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate basic operations.

1. In the new notebook, enter the following code into a cell:
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Create some data
    x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
    y = np.sin(x)

    # Plot the data
    plt.plot(x, y)
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.ylabel('sin(x)')
    plt.title('Plot of sin(x)')
    plt.show()
    ```

2. Run the cell by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

Output:
A plot of the sine function should be displayed below the cell.

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Memory Issues
If you encounter memory issues while running Jupyter Notebook, you can try increasing the available memory by using smaller datasets or optimizing your code.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies
If a package requires additional system dependencies, install them using Termux's package manager. For example:
```sh
pkg install libzmq
```

### Issue 3: Jupyter Notebook Crashes
If Jupyter Notebook crashes during a session, try increasing the available memory for Termux or using smaller datasets.

## Step 5: Advanced Topics

### Using Jupyter Notebook for Data Analysis
Jupyter Notebook is often used for data analysis and visualization. Here is an example of how to create and analyze a simple dataset.

#### Example Notebook (`data_analysis.ipynb`)
1. Create a new notebook named `data_analysis.ipynb`.
2. Add the following code to the first cell:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Create a simple dataset
    data = {
        'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],
        'Age': [24, 27, 22, 32, 29],
        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']
    }

    # Convert to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    # Display the DataFrame
    df
    ```

3. Run the cell to display the DataFrame.

4. Add the following code to the next cell:
    ```python
    # Describe the dataset
    df.describe()
    ```

5. Run the cell to display the summary statistics of the dataset.
