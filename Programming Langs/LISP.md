# Common LISP Programming in Termux

## Overview
Common LISP is a powerful, multi-paradigm programming language, known for its flexibility and efficiency. It supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. In Termux, you can use the Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) implementation to run Common LISP programs.

- **Language**: Common LISP
- **Implementation**: SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp)
- **File Extension**: `.lisp`
- **Package Name**: `sbcl`

## Step 1: Installing SBCL

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install SBCL
To install SBCL, run the following command:
```sh
pkg install sbcl
```

### Verify Installation
To verify that SBCL has been installed correctly, you can check the version:
```sh
sbcl --version
```

## Step 2: Setting Up Quicklisp

Quicklisp is a library manager for Common LISP that makes it easy to install and manage LISP libraries.

### Download and Install Quicklisp
1. Download the Quicklisp installation script:
    ```sh
    curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
    ```

2. Run the Quicklisp installation script with SBCL:
    ```sh
    sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to install Quicklisp. When asked, you can load Quicklisp automatically in future sessions by adding the following lines to your SBCL init file (`~/.sbclrc`):
    ```lisp
    (load (expand-file-name "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp"))
    ```

## Step 3: Writing and Running Common LISP Programs

### Example Program
Create a simple "Hello, World!" program in Common LISP.

1. Open Termux and create a new file named `hello.lisp` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
    ```sh
    nano hello.lisp
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```lisp
    (defun hello (name)
      (format t "Hello, ~a!~%" name))

    (hello "World")
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X` in nano, `:wq` in vi).

### Running the Common LISP Program
To run the Common LISP program, use the `sbcl` command:
```sh
sbcl --script hello.lisp
```

## Step 4: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Memory Limits
If you encounter memory limit issues, you can increase the heap size by setting the `SBCL_HEAP_SIZE` environment variable:
```sh
export SBCL_HEAP_SIZE=1024
```

### Issue 2: Missing or Corrupted Libraries
If you encounter issues related to missing or corrupted libraries, you can try reinstalling SBCL and Quicklisp:
```sh
pkg reinstall sbcl
curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
```

## Step 5: Advanced Topics

### Using Quicklisp to Manage Libraries
Quicklisp makes it easy to install and manage Common LISP libraries. Here is how you can use Quicklisp to install a library and use it in your project.

#### Example: Installing and Using the `cl-ppcre` Library
1. Start SBCL and load Quicklisp:
    ```sh
    sbcl
    (load (expand-file-name "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp"))
    ```

2. Install the `cl-ppcre` library (a regular expression library for Common LISP):
    ```lisp
    (ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")
    ```

3. Use the `cl-ppcre` library in your program:
    ```lisp
    (ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")

    (defun match-pattern (pattern string)
      (cl-ppcre:scan pattern string))

    (format t "~a~%" (match-pattern "world" "Hello, world!"))
    ```

### Creating and Loading ASDF Systems
ASDF (Another System Definition Facility) is a build system for Common LISP that manages dependencies and organizes code into systems.

#### Creating an ASDF System
1. Create a directory for your project:
    ```sh
    mkdir my-lisp-project
    cd my-lisp-project
    ```

2. Create a system definition file named `my-lisp-project.asd`:
    ```sh
    nano my-lisp-project.asd
    ```

3. Add the following code to the file:
    ```lisp
    (defsystem "my-lisp-project"
      :description "A simple Common LISP project"
      :version "0.1"
      :author "Your Name <you@example.com>"
      :license "MIT"
      :depends-on ("cl-ppcre")
      :components ((:file "main")))

    ```

4. Create the main source file named `main.lisp`:
    ```sh
    nano main.lisp
    ```

5. Add the following code to the file:
    ```lisp
    (defun main ()
      (format t "Hello, ASDF!~%"))

    (main)
    ```

6. Load and run the system:
    ```sh
    sbcl
    (load "~/quicklisp/setup.lisp")
    (ql:quickload "my-lisp-project")
    (asdf:load-system "my-lisp-project")
    ```
