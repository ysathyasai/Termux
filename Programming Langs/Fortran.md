# Fortran Programming in Termux

## Overview
Fortran is a high-level programming language that is particularly well-suited for numerical computation and scientific computing. In Termux, you can compile and run Fortran programs using GFortran, which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

- **Language**: Fortran
- **Version**: GFortran
- **File Extensions**: `.f90`, `.f95`
- **Package Name**: `gfortran`

## Step 1: Installing Fortran Compiler

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install GFortran
To install GFortran, run the following command:
```sh
pkg install gfortran
```

### Install Additional Tools
For building and managing larger projects, you may also want to install `make` and `cmake`:
```sh
pkg install make cmake
```

### Verify Installation
To verify that GFortran has been installed correctly, you can check the version:
```sh
gfortran --version
```

## Step 2: Writing and Compiling Fortran Programs

### Example Program
Create a simple "Hello, World!" program in Fortran.

1. Open Termux and create a new file named `hello.f90` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
    ```sh
    nano hello.f90
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```fortran
    program hello
        implicit none
        print *, "Hello, World!"
    end program hello
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl + X` in nano, `:wq` in vi).

### Compiling the Fortran Program
To compile the Fortran program, use GFortran:
```sh
gfortran hello.f90 -o hello
```

This command will generate an executable file named `hello`.

### Running the Compiled Program
To run the compiled program, use:
```sh
./hello
```

## Step 3: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Build Errors
If you encounter build errors, you may need to install additional tools like `binutils`:
```sh
pkg install binutils
```

### Issue 2: Missing or Corrupted Libraries
If you encounter issues related to missing or corrupted libraries, you can try reinstalling the Fortran compiler and related packages:
```sh
pkg reinstall gfortran
```

## Step 4: Advanced Topics

### Creating and Using Modules
Fortran supports modular programming through the use of modules. Modules allow you to encapsulate procedures and data.

#### Example Module (`math_operations.f90`)
```fortran
module math_operations
    implicit none
    contains
    function add(a, b)
        real :: add
        real, intent(in) :: a, b
        add = a + b
    end function add

    function subtract(a, b)
        real :: subtract
        real, intent(in) :: a, b
        subtract = a - b
    end function subtract
end module math_operations
```

#### Example Program Using the Module (`main.f90`)
```fortran
program main
    use math_operations
    implicit none
    real :: x, y
    x = 5.0
    y = 3.0
    print *, "5 + 3 =", add(x, y)
    print *, "5 - 3 =", subtract(x, y)
end program main
```

#### Compiling the Module and Program
```sh
gfortran -c math_operations.f90
gfortran main.f90 math_operations.o -o main
```

### Debugging Fortran Programs
To debug Fortran programs, you can use `gdb`, the GNU Debugger. Install `gdb` if you haven't already:
```sh
pkg install gdb
```

#### Running the Debugger
```sh
gdb ./main
```

### Using Fortran with Makefiles
For larger projects, you might want to use `make` and `Makefiles` to manage the build process.

#### Example Makefile
```makefile
all: main

main: main.o math_operations.o
    gfortran main.o math_operations.o -o main

main.o: main.f90
    gfortran -c main.f90

math_operations.o: math_operations.f90
    gfortran -c math_operations.f90

clean:
    rm -f *.o main
```

### Running `make`
To build your project using `make`, run:
```sh
make
```

### Cleaning Up
To clean up the compiled files, run:
```sh
make clean
```
