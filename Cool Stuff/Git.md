## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Termux installed on your Android device. You can download it from the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or follow this [guide](https://github.com/ysathyasai/Termux/blob/main/Guide.md) for installation instructions.

Additionally, grant storage permissions to Termux if required:
```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade Termux Packages

First, update and upgrade the Termux packages to ensure that you have the latest package lists:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
```

---

## Step 2: Install Git

To install Git in Termux, run the following command:
```bash
pkg install git -y
```

---

## Step 3: Verify Git Installation

After the installation is complete, verify that Git is installed correctly by checking the version:
```bash
git --version
```
You should see the installed Git version displayed.

---

## Step 4: Configure Git

Before using Git, configure your Git environment by setting your username and email address:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Check your configuration:
```bash
git config --list
```

## Step 5: Setting Up SSH Authentication for GitHub

Using SSH is the recommended method for authenticating with GitHub in Termux.

### Generate SSH Key

To generate an SSH key, use the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```
Follow the prompts to save the key and set a passphrase (optional).

### Start the SSH Agent

To start the SSH agent and add your SSH key:
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Add SSH Key to GitHub

Copy your SSH key to the clipboard:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

---
<h2>Log in to your GitHub account, go to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**, and add your SSH key.</h2>

---


### Test SSH Connection

To verify that the SSH connection is working, run:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
If successful, you should see a message like:
```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Clone Repository with SSH

To clone a repository using SSH, use the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

```

### Create a New Branch
To create a new branch, use the following command:

git reset --hard commit_hash
```

### Cherry-Pick a Commit
To cherry-pick a commit from another branch, use the following command:
```bash
git cherry-pick commit_hash
```

### Rebase Branches
To rebase your current branch onto another branch, use the following command:
```bash
git rebase branch_name
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors (SSH)

- Ensure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent:
  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- Verify the correct permissions for your `.ssh` directory:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

### Git Command Not Found

- Reinstall Git:
  ```bash
  pkg install git -y
  ```

### Authentication Failed

- If using HTTPS, ensure your credentials are correct.
- For SSH, regenerate and re-add your SSH key if necessary.
