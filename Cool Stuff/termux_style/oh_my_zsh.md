## Troubleshooting

1. **Zsh Not Set as Default Shell**:
   Manually set Zsh as the default shell:
   ```bash
   chsh -s zsh
   ```

2. **Missing Plugins or Themes**:
   Ensure the plugin/theme is installed in the correct directory:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
   ```

3. **Configuration Issues**:
   Reset `.zshrc` to default:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Font Issues**:
   Use a Nerd Font for better compatibility with themes like Powerlevel10k:
   ```bash
   curl -fLo ~/.termux/font.ttf https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/Ligatures/Regular/JetBrainsMonoNerdFont-Regular.ttf
