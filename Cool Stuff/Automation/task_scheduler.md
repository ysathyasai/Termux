## Overview

Startup scripts are useful for automating repetitive tasks or configuring your Termux environment when it starts. By adding commands or scripts to your Termux startup configuration, you can:
- Start background services (e.g., SSH, HTTP server).
- Set environment variables.
- Run custom scripts or commands.
- Display welcome messages or system information.

Termux executes commands from the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file when it starts, depending on the shell you are using.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up startup scripts, ensure the following:

- **Termux App**: Installed on your Android device.
- **Shell Configuration File**: Ensure you have access to `~/.bashrc` (for Bash) or `~/.zshrc` (for Zsh).
- **Scripts or Commands**: Have the scripts or commands you want to run at startup ready.

---

## Creating a Startup Script

A startup script is simply a collection of commands added to your shell's configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). These commands are executed every time Termux starts.

### Example Startup Script
Hereâ€™s an example of what you might add to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
# ============================
# Startup Script for Termux
# ============================

# Display a welcome message
echo "Welcome back to Termux!"
echo "Today's date: $(date)"

# Set environment variables
export EDITOR=nano
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

# Start SSH server if not already running
if ! pgrep -x "sshd" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Starting SSH server..."
    sshd
fi

# Check for updates
echo "Checking for package updates..."
pkg update -y

# Run a custom script
if [ -f ~/.scripts/startup.sh ]; then
    echo "Running custom startup script..."
    bash ~/.scripts/startup.sh
fi
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Shell Configuration File**: When Termux starts, it reads and executes commands from the shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
2. **Commands Execution**: Any commands or scripts added to this file are executed automatically.
3. **Customization**: You can customize the file to suit your needs, such as starting services, setting environment variables, or running scripts.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Open the Shell Configuration File

1. Open Termux.
2. Edit the `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh):
   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Step 2: Add Your Startup Commands

Copy and paste the example script provided above or customize it with your own commands. For example:
- Start an SSH server.
- Display system information.
- Run a custom script.

### Step 3: Save and Exit

Save the file and exit the editor (`Ctrl+O`, then `Enter` to save, and `Ctrl+X` to exit).

### Step 4: Apply Changes

To apply the changes immediately without restarting Termux, source the configuration file:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Example Use Cases

Here are some practical examples of startup scripts for Termux:

### 1. Display System Information
Show system information (e.g., battery status, storage usage) when Termux starts:
```bash
echo "Battery Status: $(termux-battery-status | jq -r '.percentage')%"
echo "Storage Usage: $(df -h | grep /data)"
```

### 2. Start Background Services
Start an SSH server and a Python HTTP server:
```bash
# Start SSH server
if ! pgrep -x "sshd" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Starting SSH server..."
    sshd
fi

# Start Python HTTP server
if ! pgrep -x "python" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Starting Python HTTP server on port 8000..."
    python -m http.server 8000 &
fi
```

### 3. Run Custom Scripts
Run a custom script located in `~/.scripts/startup.sh`:
```bash
if [ -f ~/.scripts/startup.sh ]; then
    echo "Running custom startup script..."
    bash ~/.scripts/startup.sh
fi
```

### 4. Set Aliases and Environment Variables
Define aliases and environment variables for convenience:
```bash
# Aliases
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'

# Environment Variables
export EDITOR=nano
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

---

## Troubleshooting

If your startup script is not working as expected, check the following:

1. **File Location**:
   Ensure you are editing the correct configuration file (`~/.bashrc` for Bash or `~/.zshrc` for Zsh).

2. **Syntax Errors**:
   Double-check the syntax of your commands. Use `bash -n ~/.bashrc` to check for syntax errors.

3. **Permissions**:
   Ensure any scripts you reference are executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.scripts/startup.sh
   ```

4. **Logs**:
   Redirect output to a log file for debugging:
   ```bash
   echo "Running startup script..." >> ~/startup.log 2>&1
   ```

5. **Conflicts**:
   Avoid conflicts with existing commands or scripts in the configuration file.
