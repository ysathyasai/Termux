# GitHub Actions Programming in Termux

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your software workflows directly from your GitHub repository. You can create workflows to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. In Termux, you can set up and manage GitHub Actions workflows for your projects.

- **Language**: YAML
- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **File Extension**: `.yml`, `.yaml`
- **Package Name**: `github-cli`

## Step 1: Setting Up GitHub CLI

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install Git
To manage your code repositories, install Git:
```sh
pkg install git
```

### Install GitHub CLI
GitHub CLI (`gh`) allows you to interact with GitHub from the command line. Install GitHub CLI by running:
```sh
pkg install gh
```

### Authenticate GitHub CLI
Authenticate `gh` with your GitHub account:
```sh
gh auth login
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the authentication process.

## Step 2: Configuring GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows are defined in YAML files stored in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

### Example Workflow
Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow to demonstrate basic operations.

1. Create a new directory for your GitHub Actions workflow:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    ```

2. Create a new file named `ci.yml` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
    ```sh
    nano .github/workflows/ci.yml
    ```

3. Add the following code to the file:
    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: '3.x'

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - name: Run tests
          run: |
            pytest
    ```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

### Running the Workflow
Push the workflow file to your GitHub repository:
```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI workflow"
git push origin main
```
GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow on the specified events (e.g., push to main branch).

## Step 3: Managing GitHub Actions Workflows

### Viewing Workflow Runs
To view the status of your workflow runs, you can use the GitHub CLI:
```sh
gh run list
```

### Viewing Workflow Logs
To view the logs of a specific workflow run, use the following command:
```sh
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

Replace `<run-id>` with the ID of the workflow run you want to view.

### Rerunning Workflows
To rerun a specific workflow run, use the following command:
```sh
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues while running GitHub Actions workflows, ensure that the necessary permissions are granted in your repository settings.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies
If a package requires additional system dependencies, install them using Termux's package manager. For example:
```sh
pkg install curl
```

### Issue 3: Environment Configuration
If your GitHub Actions workflow fails due to environment configuration issues, ensure that all necessary environment variables are set. For example:
```sh
env:
  ENV_VAR: value
```
