# CI/CD Pipelines in Termux

## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are crucial practices in modern software development. They enable teams to integrate code changes frequently, automatically test the changes, and deploy them to production. In Termux, you can set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or other CI/CD platforms that support command-line interfaces.

- **Language**: Various
- **Platform**: CI/CD
- **File Extension**: `.yml`, `.yaml`
- **Package Name**: Various

## Step 1: Setting Up CI/CD Tools

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install Git
To manage your code repositories, install Git:
```sh
pkg install git
```

### Install Docker (Optional)
Docker can be used to create containerized environments for CI/CD pipelines. Install Docker by running:
```sh
pkg install docker
```

### Install Python (Optional)
Python is commonly used in CI/CD scripts for automation. Install Python by running:
```sh
pkg install python
```

### Install Node.js (Optional)
Node.js is another popular language for CI/CD scripts. Install Node.js by running:
```sh
pkg install nodejs
```

## Step 2: Configuring GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a popular CI/CD platform that integrates directly with GitHub repositories. You can create workflows to automate your CI/CD pipelines.

### Example Workflow
Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow to demonstrate basic operations.

1. Create a new directory for your GitHub Actions workflow:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    ```

2. Create a new file named `ci.yml` using a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
    ```sh
    nano .github/workflows/ci.yml
    ```

3. Add the following code to the file:
    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
      pull_request:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Python
          uses: actions/setup-python@v2
          with:
            python-version: '3.x'

        - name: Install dependencies
          run: |
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt

        - name: Run tests
          run: |
            pytest
    ```

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

### Running the Workflow
Push the workflow file to your GitHub repository:
```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI workflow"
git push origin main
```
GitHub Actions will automatically run the workflow on the specified events (e.g., push to main branch).

## Step 3: Configuring Jenkins

Jenkins is another popular CI/CD platform that can be installed and configured in Termux.

### Install Jenkins
To install Jenkins, follow the official Jenkins installation guide for your environment. You may need to install additional dependencies like Java.

### Example Jenkins Pipeline
Create a simple Jenkins pipeline to demonstrate basic operations.

1. Open Jenkins and create a new pipeline project.

2. In the pipeline script, add the following code:
    ```groovy
    pipeline {
        agent any

        stages {
            stage('Checkout') {
                steps {
                    git 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
                }
            }

            stage('Build') {
                steps {
                    sh 'make build'
                }
            }

            stage('Test') {
                steps {
                    sh 'make test'
                }
            }

            stage('Deploy') {
                steps {
                    sh 'make deploy'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Running the Pipeline
Save the pipeline script and run the pipeline. Jenkins will automatically execute the defined stages.

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues while running CI/CD scripts, ensure that the necessary permissions are granted. For example:
```sh
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies
If a package requires additional system dependencies, install them using Termux's package manager. For example:
```sh
pkg install curl
```

### Issue 3: Environment Configuration
If your CI/CD pipeline fails due to environment configuration issues, ensure that all necessary environment variables are set. For example:
```sh
export ENV_VAR=value
```
