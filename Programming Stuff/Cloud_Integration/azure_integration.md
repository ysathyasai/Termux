# Azure Integration in Termux

## Overview
Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service that provides a wide range of cloud services, including computing, analytics, storage, and networking. In Termux, you can set up and manage Azure resources using the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). This guide will help you install the Azure CLI, configure it, and perform basic operations.

- **Language**: Shell
- **Platform**: Azure CLI
- **File Extension**: `.sh`
- **Package Name**: `azure-cli`

## Step 1: Installing Azure CLI

### Update and Upgrade Termux Packages
Before installing new packages, it's a good practice to update and upgrade your existing packages:
```sh
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Install Python
To install Python, run the following command:
```sh
pkg install python
```

### Install Pip
Pip is the package manager for Python. Install it by running:
```sh
pkg install python-pip
```

### Install Azure CLI
To install Azure CLI, use pip:
```sh
pip install azure-cli
```

### Verify Installation
To verify that Azure CLI has been installed correctly, you can run a simple command:
```sh
az --version
```

## Step 2: Configuring Azure CLI

### Configure Azure CLI
To configure Azure CLI with your Azure account, run the following command:
```sh
az login
```

You will be prompted to open a web browser and enter a code to authenticate. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the authentication process.

## Step 3: Performing Basic Operations

### List Azure Resource Groups
To list all resource groups in your Azure account, use the following command:
```sh
az group list --output table
```

### Create an Azure Resource Group
To create a new resource group, use the following command:
```sh
az group create --name your-resource-group --location your-location
```

### List Azure Virtual Machines
To list all virtual machines in a specific resource group, use the following command:
```sh
az vm list --resource-group your-resource-group --output table
```

### Start an Azure Virtual Machine
To start a virtual machine, use the following command:
```sh
az vm start --resource-group your-resource-group --name your-vm-name
```

### Stop an Azure Virtual Machine
To stop a virtual machine, use the following command:
```sh
az vm stop --resource-group your-resource-group --name your-vm-name
```

## Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Permission Issues
If you encounter permission issues while using Azure CLI, ensure that your Azure account has the necessary permissions to perform the required actions.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependencies
If a package requires additional system dependencies, install them using Termux's package manager. For example:
```sh
pkg install curl
```

### Issue 3: Azure CLI Configuration Issues
If Azure CLI configuration fails, ensure that you have entered the correct Azure credentials and that your account has the necessary permissions.

## Step 5: Advanced Topics

### Using Azure CLI for Automation
Azure CLI can be used in shell scripts to automate Azure tasks. Here is an example of how to create a simple script to start and stop an Azure virtual machine.

#### Example Script (`azure_vm_control.sh`)
1. Create a new file named `azure_vm_control.sh`:
    ```sh
    nano azure_vm_control.sh
    ```

2. Add the following code to the file:
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh

    RESOURCE_GROUP="your-resource-group"
    VM_NAME="your-vm-name"

    case "$1" in
        start)
            az vm start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME
            ;;
        stop)
            az vm stop --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME
            ;;
        status)
            az vm get-instance-view --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $VM_NAME --query "instanceView.statuses[1]" --output table
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status}"
            exit 1
    esac
    ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Make the script executable:
    ```sh
    chmod +x azure_vm_control.sh
    ```

5. Run the script to start, stop, or check the status of the Azure virtual machine:
    ```sh
    ./azure_vm_control.sh start
    ./azure_vm_control.sh stop
    ./azure_vm_control.sh status
    ```
