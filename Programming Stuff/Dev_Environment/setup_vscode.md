## Overview

Code-Server is a lightweight, self-hosted version of Visual Studio Code that runs in your browser. It provides all the features of VS Code, including syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, debugging, and extensions, but it can be accessed remotely via a web interface. In this guide, we'll set up Code-Server in Termux, configure it for productivity, and explore its capabilities as a development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

- **Termux App**: Latest version installed from the Play Store or F-Droid.
- **Storage Permission**: Granted to Termux (`termux-setup-storage`).
- **Internet Connection**: A stable internet connection is required for downloading packages and tools.
- **Device Storage**: Ensure sufficient free storage space (at least 1 GB recommended).
- **Browser**: A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) installed on your Android device.

## Installation

### Step 1: Update Termux Packages
Ensure all Termux packages are up to date:
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies for running Code-Server:
```bash
pkg install curl wget openssl-tool nodejs-lts npm
```

### Step 3: Download and Install Code-Server
Download the latest version of Code-Server and extract it:

1. Visit the [Code-Server Releases Page](https://github.com/coder/code-server/releases) and copy the download link for the Linux ARM64 binary.

2. Download the binary in Termux:
   ```bash
   wget <download-link> -O code-server.tar.gz
   ```

3. Extract the archive:
   ```bash
   tar -xvzf code-server.tar.gz
   ```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:
   ```bash
   cd code-server-<version>-linux-arm64
   ```

5. Make the `code-server` binary executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x code-server
   ```

## Running Code-Server

### Accessing Code-Server Locally
Run Code-Server on your local machine:
```bash
./code-server --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Open a browser on your Android device and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Accessing Code-Server Remotely
To access Code-Server from another device on the same network:

1. Find your device's IP address:
   ```bash
   ip addr show wlan0 | grep 'inet '
   ```

2. Run Code-Server with your device's IP address:
   ```bash
   ./code-server --bind-addr <your-ip>:8080
   ```

3. Open a browser on another device and navigate to:
   ```
   http://<your-ip>:8080
   ```

## Configuration

### Setting a Password
By default, Code-Server generates a random password. To set a custom password:

1. Create a configuration directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/code-server
   ```

2. Create a `config.yaml` file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.config/code-server/config.yaml
   ```

3. Add the following settings:
   ```yaml
   bind-addr: 127.0.0.1:8080
   auth: password
   password: yourpassword
   cert: false
   ```

4. Save the file and restart Code-Server:
   ```bash
   ./code-server
   ```

### Customizing Settings
You can customize Code-Server settings by editing the `settings.json` file in the browser interface or directly in the `.config/code-server/settings.json` file.

## Installing Extensions

Install extensions just like you would in regular VS Code:

1. Open the Extensions sidebar in Code-Server.
2. Search for an extension (e.g., "Python", "C++").
3. Click "Install" to add the extension to Code-Server.

Extensions are stored locally and persist across sessions.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Out of Memory Errors
- **Cause**: Limited memory on Android devices.
- **Solution**:
  Close unnecessary apps to free up memory.
  Use lightweight extensions and themes.

### 2. Slow Performance
- **Cause**: High resource usage during execution.
- **Solution**:
  Reduce the number of open files and extensions.
  Use a lower resolution for the browser interface.

### 3. Cannot Connect Remotely
- **Cause**: Firewall or incorrect IP address.
- **Solution**:
  Ensure your device's firewall allows traffic on port 8080.
  Double-check the IP address using `ip addr show`.

### 4. Missing Features
- **Cause**: Outdated Code-Server version.
- **Solution**:
  Download the latest version from the [Code-Server Releases Page](https://github.com/coder/code-server/releases).
