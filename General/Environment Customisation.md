# Environment Customization Guide for Termux

## Introduction
This guide provides detailed steps on how to customize the Termux environment. We will cover customizing the shell environment using `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, installing and configuring themes and plugins, and creating aliases and functions for productivity.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have Termux installed on your Android device. You can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).
Alternatively, follow this [guide](https://github.com/ysathyasai/Termux/blob/main/Guide.md) for installation instructions.

## Step 1: Customizing the Termux Environment

### Using `.bashrc` for Shell Customization
The `.bashrc` file is a script that is executed whenever a new terminal session is started in Bash. You can customize your environment by adding commands to this file.

#### Creating or Editing `.bashrc`
To create or edit the `.bashrc` file, use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
```sh
nano ~/.bashrc
```

#### Example `.bashrc` Customizations
Here are some example customizations you can add to your `.bashrc` file:
```sh
# Set a custom prompt
PS1='\[\e[1;32m\]\u@\h:\w\$\[\e[0m\] '

# Set environment variables
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

# Create aliases
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'

# Set default editor
export EDITOR=nano
```

### Using `.zshrc` for Shell Customization
If you prefer using Zsh instead of Bash, you can customize your environment using the `.zshrc` file. Install Zsh and set it as the default shell:
```sh
pkg install zsh
chsh -s zsh
```

#### Creating or Editing `.zshrc`
To create or edit the `.zshrc` file, use a text editor like `nano` or `vi`:
```sh
nano ~/.zshrc
```

#### Example `.zshrc` Customizations
Here are some example customizations you can add to your `.zshrc` file:
```sh
# Set a custom prompt
PROMPT='%F{green}%n@%m:%~%f$ '

# Set environment variables
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

# Create aliases
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'

# Set default editor
export EDITOR=nano
```

## Step 2: Installing and Configuring Themes and Plugins

### Installing Oh My Zsh
Oh My Zsh is a framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes with a lot of themes and plugins. To install Oh My Zsh:
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### Setting a Theme
To set a theme, edit your `.zshrc` file and set the `ZSH_THEME` variable:
```sh
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

### Installing Plugins
Oh My Zsh comes with many plugins. To enable a plugin, add it to the `plugins` array in your `.zshrc` file:
```sh
plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```

#### Installing `zsh-autosuggestions` Plugin
To install the `zsh-autosuggestions` plugin:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

#### Installing `zsh-syntax-highlighting` Plugin
To install the `zsh-syntax-highlighting` plugin:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Step 3: Aliases and Functions for Productivity

### Creating Aliases
Aliases allow you to create shortcuts for commands. Add aliases to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
```sh
alias update='pkg update && pkg upgrade'
alias cls='clear'
```

### Creating Functions
Functions allow you to group commands and reuse them. Add functions to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
```sh
backup() {
    tar -czf "$1-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S).tar.gz" "$1"
    echo "Backup of $1 completed."
}
```

## Step 4: Using a Custom `.bashrc` File

If you want to use a preconfigured `.bashrc` file, you can download and apply it from a public repository.

### Downloading and Applying a Custom `.bashrc`

To download and use a custom `.bashrc` file, run:

```css
curl -o ~/.bashrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enjoy-pandugo-cloud/Termux/main/General/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Orelse check this [ .bashrc file](https://github.com/Enjoy-pandugo-cloud/Termux/tree/main/General/.bashrc/) once.

## Conclusion
You have successfully customized your Termux environment, including using `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for shell customization, installing and configuring themes and plugins, and creating aliases and functions for productivity. For more advanced usage and features, refer to the official documentation of each tool.

Happy customizing!
