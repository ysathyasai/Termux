## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

1. **Termux Installed**: Download and install Termux from the official source (F-Droid or GitHub).
2. **Internet Connection**: Ensure your device has an active internet connection.
3. **Storage Permissions**: Grant storage permissions to Termux if required:
   ```bash
   termux-setup-storage
   ```

## Installing Git

Install Git using the Termux package manager:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install git -y
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Configuring Git

Set up your Git identity (username and email). These details will be associated with your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Check your configuration:

```bash
git config --list
```

---

## Basic Git Workflow

### Initializing a Repository

Create a new Git repository in your current directory:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a `.git` folder to track changes.

---

### Cloning a Repository

Clone the repository from your provided URL:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ysathyasai/Termux.git
```

For SSH-based cloning (requires SSH key setup):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ysathyasai/Termux.git
```

---

### Staging Changes

Stage files for the next commit:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

To stage all changes:

```bash
git add .
```

---

### Committing Changes

Commit staged changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

---

### Pushing to Remote

Push your local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

For example, to push to the `main` branch:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Advanced Features

### SSH Key Setup

To avoid entering your username and password every time you interact with a remote repository, set up an SSH key.

1. Generate an SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   Press Enter to accept default paths and optionally set a passphrase.

2. Copy the public key to your clipboard:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

3. Add the key to your GitHub account under **Settings > SSH Keys**.

4. Test the connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### Branch Management

#### Create a New Branch
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

#### Switch to a Branch
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

#### Create and Switch to a Branch in One Step
```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

#### Merge a Branch
Switch to the target branch and merge:
```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch_name>
```

#### Delete a Branch
```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors (SSH)

- Ensure your SSH key is added to the SSH agent:
  ```bash
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- Verify the correct permissions for your `.ssh` directory:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

### Git Command Not Found

- Reinstall Git:
  ```bash
  pkg install git -y
  ```

### Authentication Failed

- If using HTTPS, ensure your credentials are correct.
- For SSH, regenerate and re-add your SSH key if necessary.
