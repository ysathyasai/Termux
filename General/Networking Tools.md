```

#### Downloading a File to a Specific Directory
```sh
wget -P /path/to/directory http://example.com/file.txt
```

### Using `ping`
`ping` is used to test the reachability of a host and measure the round-trip time for messages sent to the destination. Here are some basic examples:

#### Pinging a Host
```sh
ping example.com
```

#### Pinging a Host with a Specific Number of Packets
```sh
ping -c 4 example.com
```

## Step 4: Monitoring Network Traffic

### Installing `iftop`
`iftop` is a command-line tool for monitoring network traffic. To install `iftop`, run:
```sh
pkg install iftop
```

### Using `iftop`
To start monitoring network traffic with `iftop`, run:
```sh
iftop
```
Use the arrow keys to navigate and press `q` to quit.

### Installing `tcpdump`
`tcpdump` is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. To install `tcpdump`, run:
```sh
pkg install tcpdump
```

### Using `tcpdump`
To capture packets on a network interface, run:
```sh
tcpdump -i any
```
Press `Ctrl + C` to stop capturing.

## Step 5: Setting Up and Using SSH

### Installing OpenSSH
To install OpenSSH in Termux, run:
```sh
pkg install openssh
```

### Generating SSH Key Pair
To generate an SSH key pair, use the following command:
```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```
Follow the prompts to save the key and set a passphrase (optional).

### Starting the SSH Server
To start the SSH server, use:
```sh
sshd
```

### Connecting to the SSH Server
To connect to your Termux SSH server from another device, use:
```sh
ssh -p 8022 username@hostname
```
Replace `username` with your Termux username and `hostname` with the IP address of your Android device.

### Using SSH to Connect to a Remote Server
To connect to a remote server using SSH, use:
```sh
ssh username@remote_host
```
Replace `username` with your username on the remote server and `remote_host` with the remote server's address.
