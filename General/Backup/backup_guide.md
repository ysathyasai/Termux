## Overview

Backing up your Termux environment is crucial to prevent data loss. This guide covers creating a compressed archive of your Termux home directory and restoring it when needed. The backup includes:
- Installed packages
- Configurations (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`)
- Scripts and personal files
- Package lists for easy reinstallation

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:

- **Termux App**: Latest version installed
- **Storage Permission**: Granted to Termux (`termux-setup-storage`)
- **Basic Tools**: Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pkg install tar gzip -y
  ```

---

## Backup Process

### Step 1: Create a Backup Directory
Create a directory to store your backups:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup
```

### Step 2: Generate a Timestamped Backup
Run the following command to create a timestamped backup archive:
```bash
tar -czf ~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup/termux_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz -C ~/ . --exclude="storage"
```

- **Explanation**:
  - `tar`: Creates an archive.
  - `-czf`: Compresses the archive using gzip.
  - `~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup/`: Stores the backup in the shared storage directory.
  - `--exclude="storage"`: Excludes external storage to save space.

### Step 3: Verify the Backup
List the contents of the backup directory to confirm the archive was created:
```bash
ls ~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup/
```

## Restoring from Backup

### Step 1: Extract the Backup Archive
Navigate to your home directory and extract the backup:
```bash
cd ~
tar -xzf ~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup/termux_backup_<timestamp>.tar.gz
```

Replace `<timestamp>` with the actual timestamp of your backup file.

### Step 2: Reinstall Packages
If the backup does not include installed packages, reinstall them using the package list:
```bash
pkg install $(cat pkg_list.txt) -y
```

To generate a package list before backing up:
```bash
pkg list-installed > ~/pkg_list.txt
```

Include this `pkg_list.txt` file in your backup directory.

## Automating Backups

### Step 1: Create a Backup Script
Save the following script as `~/.scripts/backup.sh`:
```bash
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash

# Set backup directory
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/storage/shared/TermuxBackup"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="termux_backup_$DATE.tar.gz"

# Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Create backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE" -C $HOME . --exclude="storage"

# Keep only last 5 backups
cd "$BACKUP_DIR" && ls -t termux_backup_* | tail -n +6 | xargs -r rm -f
```

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.scripts/backup.sh
```

### Step 2: Schedule Backups with Cron
Install `cronie` if not already installed:
```bash
pkg install cronie
```

Start the cron service:
```bash
crond
```

Edit the crontab file:
```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to schedule daily backups at 2 AM:
```bash
0 2 * * * ~/.scripts/backup.sh >> ~/.scripts/backup.log 2>&1
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Backup Fails**:
   Ensure you have enough storage space:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

2. **Restore Issues**:
   Verify the integrity of the backup archive:
   ```bash
   tar -tzf ~/storage/shared/TermuxBackup/termux_backup_<timestamp>.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Missing Files**:
   Ensure the backup includes all necessary files by reviewing the `tar` command.

4. **Cron Logs**:
   Check the cron log file for errors:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.scripts/backup.log
   ```
